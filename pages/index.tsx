The film is about the discovery of an underground cinema cavern on the Isle of Portland: the uncanny discovery and subsequent breaking news begin to generate speculation amongst islanders as to who created the cavern and the canisters of film found within it. Kimberlin features a specially commissioned soundtrack by acclaimed electronic musician Abul Mogard."
